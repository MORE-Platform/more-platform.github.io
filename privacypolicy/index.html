<p>Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft - Österreichische Vereinigung zur F örderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (registered in Nu ßdorfer Stra ße 64, 6. Stock, 1090 Wien, Österreich), represented by Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Prevention (located at Lindhofstra ße 22, 5020 Salzburg, Austria, Tel +43 (0) 57255 82701; hereinafter “LBI-DHP ”) acts as the data controller of your personal data and takes your privacy and the protection of your personal data seriously.</p>
<p>With this privacy policy we want to explain to you how and why we use your personal data when you use the MORE app. We do it with care, and we follow applicable law, including but not limited to the rules of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>To be able to provide you with the MORE service (i.e., to enable you to participate in studies as configured by a study controller, which may include receiving and responding to surveys or questionnaires and participating in sensor data collection from mobile phones, or wearable or stationary sensor device connected to the MORE platform or app) we need some information about you (i.e., your personal data):</p>
<pre><code>Your IP address (the address of your device on the internet, which makes it unique);
Your time zone;
The type and operating system of your device;
The version of the app you are using;
Information about technical issues of the app (such as crashes);
Sensor data including e.g.:

Acceleration via mobile accelerometer
Location via mobile GPS
Heart rate via a Polar Verity Sense wearable sensing device

Questionnaire &amp;survey data via Limesurvey and simple question implementation (directly in platform)
Data you agree to be collected as part of the informed consent procedures and data collection explanation and justification which are a legal requirement for the study controller.
</code></pre>
<p>Our legitimate interest for collecting, storing and utilizing your personal data in the categories listed above is to give you the right and ability to use our service, to improve our services, by correcting errors and adding new functionalities, as well as to inform you of updates of the app. We may also, for the same reason, need to use your personal data to defend ourselves in the frame of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Whenever taking part in a study, explicit consent for each data collection module used in that study has to be given by the user.</p>
<p>We also use your personal data because we were asked to by the survey provider, in order to enroll you and analyze the answers you give to the survey and questionnaires sent to you via the app. Your survey provider will tell you what they do with the answers you give to questions they send you. If they haven ’t done that yet, you have the right to ask them to do so.</p>
<p>We may therefore share your data with researchers associated to the respective study via their role as administrator, operator or viewer. We will not transfer your personal data to any third party without your written consent.</p>
<p>The use of the MORE platform is entirely voluntary. The above data is processed on the basis of your consent to take part in a study run by the MORE platform.</p>
<p>We store and process your personal data no longer than needed for meeting the purposes for which your data were collected, i.e., study and research purposes.</p>
<p>Your personal data is kept confidential and LBI-DHP provides all reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data. We take all appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, including appropriate identity management measures, pseudonymization and anonymization where possible, encryption where needed. Your data will stay with us, in the EU or on services providing a legally permissible GDPR adequacy recognition. Please note that subject to terms and conditions set out for participation in a particular study through the informed consent materials for that study or any other legally permitted information pathway, the study controller may obtain, modify, utilize and possibly publish your data.</p>
<p>We will keep your personal data confidential, and we will do all we reasonably can to keep it safe, on our servers. We will use organizational measures such as access management, which means that we will make sure that within our organization and also among registered members of a study team only selected persons can access your data. We will also implement technical measures to secure your data, such as anonymisation and pseudonymisation, and encryption in storage and particularly in transport.</p>
<p>We will only keep your data for as long as we need it to provide you with our service or to defend ourselves in the frame of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>You can ask us for a copy of your data, you can also ask us to correct data that is wrong and add missing information. You can ask us to stop using your data and erase it. Under certain conditions, you can also ask us to use your data only for specific reasons.</p>
<p>You can also delete any data that is currently held in the app on your phone yourself by deleting the application and selecting for all linked local data to be removed as well, if you are really sure you do not want to use it anymore. But don ’t forget that once the data is deleted you (or we) cannot recover it!</p>
<p>You can ask us about all of the above by sending us an e-mail at <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a question or complaint, please let us know by sending an e-mail to <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a></strong>. In any case, you also have the right to complain directly to the competent data protection authority.</p>
<p>We will inform you about material changes to this privacy policy on the app.</p>
<p>You can revoke this consent at any time. A revocation has the consequence that we will no longer process your data for the above-mentioned purposes from this point on. For a revocation, please contact: <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a></strong>. If you delete your user account within MORE, your profile will be stored for 14 days before permanent deletion of the data. The profile will not be available or accessible during this period.</p>
<p>After registration you can stop using the MORE platform at any time, which includes the deletion of all data from you. For deletion of data please contact: <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint about our processing of your data or the exercise of your rights, please contact us directly (see below) or via mail: <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The MORE platform uses technical service providers (as subcontractors) to perform its services. If you have any questions with regard to these providers, please contact: <strong><a href="mailto:more@dhp.lbg.ac.at">more@dhp.lbg.ac.at</a></strong>.</p>
